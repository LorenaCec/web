                    one of the grandkids said he didn't think it was possible to have a better vacation. They did everything they could 
                    at least once and I got a "Worlds Greatist Gramma" trophy  presented to me at dinner on the last night.
                    Thanks again!!!!"</p>

                    were wonderful, from location to ambience to lovely and caring staff. 
                    The first week in Kenya at Leah's camp was truly amazing, followed by two nights at Ol Pejeta House, 
                    which I wholeheartedly would recommend to you and your clients. I am so grateful to you!"</p>

                    "A somewhat belated huge THANK YOU for a fabulous trip! All of the hotels were superb - 
                    wasn't one that we didn't thoroughly love.  The Timeo was gorgeous - and we even got treated to a 
                    fireworks display one night as some celebration.  Our room was at the corner that looked out over the pool 
                    and over the dining area so we had a spectacular show at midnight!  
                    The Bellevue Syrene was gorgeous!  What a fabulous property!"</p>
